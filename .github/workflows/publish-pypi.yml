# CI/CD Hub - PyPI Publishing Workflow
# ============================================================================
# Publishes cihub to PyPI when a release is created or a version tag is pushed.
#
# Prerequisites (Trusted Publishing - no secrets needed!):
#   1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
#   2. Add pending publisher: owner=jguida941, repo=ci-cd-hub,
#      workflow=publish-pypi.yml, environment=pypi
#   3. Same for TestPyPI with environment=testpypi
#
# Usage:
#   - Push a tag: git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0
#   - Or create a GitHub Release via the UI
#
# The package will be available at: https://pypi.org/project/cihub/
# Install with: pip install cihub
