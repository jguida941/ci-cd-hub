---

## Part 1: README Remaining Issues

### Missing Commands

| Command | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `docs generate` | NOT in README | HIGH |
| `docs check` | NOT in README | HIGH |
| `docs stale` | NOT in README | HIGH |
| `docs audit` | NOT in README | MEDIUM |
| `verify --remote` | NOT in README | HIGH |

### Missing from Check Tiers

- `--security` tier: Missing **gitleaks**
- `--full` tier: Missing **zizmor**

### Missing Flags

- `--install-missing` flag for check command
- `--require-optional` flag for check command

---

## Part 2: GETTING_STARTED Issues

### CRITICAL: Wrong apply-profile Syntax

**Current (WRONG):**
```
| `cihub config apply-profile <profile> --repo <name>` | Apply a profile |
```

**Correct:**
```
| `cihub config apply-profile --profile <path> [--target <path>]` | Apply a profile |
```

### Missing Commands

- `cihub setup` - Not in Key Commands table (README features it prominently)
- `cihub registry` - New feature, completely undocumented
- `cihub verify` - Not in Key Commands table
- `cihub discover` - Not documented
- `cihub hub` - Not documented

---

## Part 3: TROUBLESHOOTING Minor Gaps

### Missing Triage Advanced Options

These are documented in CLI.md but not in TROUBLESHOOTING:
- `--watch` - Background daemon mode
- `--detect-flaky` - Flaky test analysis
- `--gate-history` - Gate status over time
- `--min-severity`, `--category` - Filtering options

---

## Part 4: TOOLS.md Critical Gaps

### Status: HAND-WRITTEN (Should be Generated)

No "Generated by" banner - drifting from code.

### Missing Tools (No Detail Sections)

| Tool | Languages | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| docker | Both | Completely missing |
| sbom | Both | Completely missing |
| jqwik | Java | Only in matrix, no detail |

### Missing Config Options (ALL Tools)

- `require_run_or_fail` - Not documented for ANY tool
- `fail_on_*` variants - Incomplete (Bandit has 3, only 1 documented)
- `max_*` thresholds - Missing for many tools

---

## Part 5: Cross-Doc Consistency Issues

### Check Tier Tools Mismatch

| Tier | README | GETTING_STARTED |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Fast | "lint, format, type, test" | "preflight, ruff, mypy, yamllint, pytest, actionlint, docs-check, smoke" |
| Security | "bandit, pip-audit, trivy" | "bandit, pip-audit, trivy, **gitleaks**" |
| Full | "templates, matrix, license" | "templates, matrix, license, **zizmor**" |

### cihub setup Missing from GETTING_STARTED

- README prominently features `cihub setup`
- GETTING_STARTED has no section for it

---
